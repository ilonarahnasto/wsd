- Alexia Leimu, 474500

2. Goal
- To create an online game store for javascript games
- The store will have two user groups: developers and players
- The store should be as easy to use as possible for both groups
- Our goal for this project is to get the best possible grade on the course (+3).

3. Plans
- The features we will include:
	- authentication
  - play games, buy games, search games
  - add games, allow developers to see game statistics
  - security restrictions for both user groups
  - keep track of and submit scores
- Extra features:
	- own game
  - mobile friendly
  - possibly social media sharing

3.1 Layout
- We will create a layout that is clear and modern with good usability. It will be completely mobile compatible.
- The pages of the service will at least include a header, a navigation bar, the page content and a footer.

3.2 Methods
- We are using git and have a GitLab repository for our project.
- Our team will communicate through Telegram, and also have frequent face-to-face meetings.
- All changes will be documented, so each member of the team is up-to-date on the progress
- We will develop the project both individually and together as a group

- For the front-end, we will either use Bootstrap or Google Material Design libraries.

- We are using Django as the web-framework.


3.3 Project structure
- URL-structure will be implemented in urls.py, avoiding a single page app
- Methods will be implemented in models.py
- We aim to comment the code well to make it easy to understand

3.4 Priorities
- Usability and
- To achieve a goods user interface, we will be doing user testing (described more in paragraph 5.)

4. Time schedule
- We will complete the project in good time to avoid a need for rushing
- We will have group meetings at least once a week

	- week 1: division of tasks, thorough planning of our project's different sections, finalization of the layout
	- week 2-4: researching and coding individually and as a group, satrting with HTML and CSS, and moving on to functionalities
  - week 5: complete our individual tasks
  - week 6-7: testing, user testing and improving our project based on the results
  - Final submission - 19.2.2017 midnight (end of period III)
  - Project demonstrations - few weeks after submission, announced when space has been reserved

5. Testing
- We will test the project frequently and use validators to validate HTML and CSS
- Every feature will be tested for easier troubleshooting
- We will have friends use our site to test the usability and to receive feedback
- User testing will give us new aspects we probably haven't thought of
- User testing will include a google form to receive quantitative results

6. Risk Analysis
- All possible risks lead to the project being delayed
- One of our planned features proves to be harder than imagined and delays the project
- A group member gets sick or is otherwise unable to complete tasks and delays the project
- Something happens to our code, it disappears or doesn't update
- A group member's computer breaks
- These risks can be avoided with good communication and reserving enough time for each stage
